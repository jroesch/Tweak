#Tweak
A simple embeddable scripting language for experimentation with dynamic adjustment of static code. The goal is to create an environment for people to visually interact with things in a tactile way. Tweak is intended to be a the component that allows for effortless 'tweaking' of parameters like color, time, motion, animation, and so on. Part of this motivation is why it is intially targeting the JVM for ease of binding to GUI toolkits like Swing, and utilize lower-level high performant code in the form of Scala and Java with bindings such as LWGL.
